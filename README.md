# Python - Applications
This Repository consists of different **COMMAND LINE APPLICATIONS** that I made using Python.

Given a Directory path, Renames the contents of the Directory with the new name provided by the user. b. Takes care of renaming the files with correct extensions. c. User can Undo the rename operation.(Only Once)

-	### Tic_Tac_Toe_Game: 
  > It is a 2-player game on a NxN board size. The User should choose a board size before playing. However, if a user chooses the size less than 3 then the board size is taken as 3 by default. There are two modes of playing in this: a. Computer vs Player - Where a player can play with the Computer. b. Player vs Player - A player plays with another player.

-	### Flipkart Mobile Price Finder: 
  > Given a bunch of links of different Mobile Phones on Flipkart, this script will find the price of those items and print it on the command line. 
This is used to keep a track of an item's price that a user would like to buy so that he can make a purchase when there is a price drop.

-	### Online Coding Platforms Rating Tracker: 
  > Given the URLs of users profile in Codeforces, Codechef, Hacker Earth, SPOJ and Interview Bit,  this script will print their respective ratings and ranks. By running this script, a user can check his all ratings without explicitly navigating to the respective URLs.
